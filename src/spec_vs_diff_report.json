  "summary": "The implementation covers most requirements including product categories (22K/18K/9K Gold), running banner for Lab Grown Diamonds, admin panel enhancements (product/inventory/order/carousel management), homepage carousel with admin upload, and design styling matching the reference site. However, Google Pay UPI integration (REQ-4) appears incomplete, lacking actual payment gateway integration and proper order confirmation flow.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Integrate Google Pay UPI for checkout and payment processing with functional UPI payment flow and order confirmation after successful payment",
      "reason": "The CheckoutPage only opens a UPI deep link (upi://) without implementing actual payment verification or integration. There's no mechanism to confirm successful payment before order placement, and the order placement is decoupled from payment completion.",
